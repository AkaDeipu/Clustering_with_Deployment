Clustering with Deployment
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using clustering techniques and showcases how to deploy a machine learning pipeline in a production-ready environment.

Project Overview
Built a customer segmentation model using clustering algorithms.

Packaged the workflow into a pipeline (clst_pipeline.pkl) for reproducibility.

Developed a Streamlit/Flask app (app.py) to serve predictions interactively.

Created a feature engineering module (cxloyaltyfeature.py) for preprocessing and custom transformations.

Provided a Jupyter Notebook (Customer_Segmentation.ipynb) with exploratory data analysis, clustering experiments, and evaluation.

Managed dependencies with a clean requirements.txt for environment setup.

Features
End-to-end clustering workflow: data preprocessing → model training → deployment.

Modular design for easy updates and scaling.

Interactive app for real-time customer segmentation.

Reproducible pipeline with version-pinned requirements.

Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Streamlit/Flask for deployment

Pickle for pipeline serialization
